# The Saddle-Point Accountant
An algorithm to compose privacy guarantees of differentially private (DP) algorithms in the large composition regime, i.e., when a privacy mechanism is sequentially applied a large number of times. Our method uses the notion of privacy loss random variables, along with techniques from mathematical physics and statistics, to quantify the privacy loss of DP algorithms. 

This code accompanies the paper "The Saddle-Point Method in Differential Privacy". See the Google Colab notebook ```Main_Body_Figures.ipynb``` for code that replicates all figures in the main body.
